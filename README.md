# Problem Statement

Design a Airline Booking System which has following function requirements. 

1. Take user inputs for Source, Destination, Date, Passenger number.
2. Show details for the available flights between two cities. Details should include Airline Name, Flight Number, Departure, Arrival, number of vacant seats and Price. It should have a book button which would perform the checkout functionality.
3. Support two different seat classes. Support Round Trip as well as One way journey.
4. Authenticate the users at Checkout. If authenticated proceed to Booking functionality else prompt user for signin/signup.
5. Post authentication proceeds to Payment. [We are simply displaying a dummy payment page and then redirecting it to Booking confirmation and not handling the payments.]

# Approach

Flight Reservation System contains functionalities like login , register , search, checkout, admin login, adding flight, saving user booking data and display user booking data. We have used postgresql for storing data about users and flight details. The system allows the airline passenger to search for flights that are available between the two travel cities, namely the ‚ÄúDeparture city‚Äù and ‚ÄúArrival city‚Äù for  particular departure date. The system displays all the flight‚Äôs details such as flight no, name, price  duration of journey etc. After search the system display list of available flights and allows customer to choose a particular flight. Then the system checks for the availability of seats on the flight. If the seats are available then the system allows the passenger to book a seat. OtherWise it will not display the data. It has a functionality of viewing user history which will store the info about the flight the user has booked. The user booking history is stored in the database so that the user can access the data whenever he wants. There is a seperate login page for Users and Admin. Admins has access to special functionalities like adding flights in flight database etc. There is a seperate database and login page for user and admins. To book a flight the system asks the customer to enter his details such as name, Username, credit card number and contact number. Then it checks whether the validity of user and books the flight and update the airline database and user database.

# Wireframing

Miro has been used for creating the wireframes after the initial whiteboard wireframing.

# Prototyping

We have used Figma to prototype the UX. We chose Figma to do the Mockup because it was collaborative and helped us follow the product-centric approach. The overall exact design has been achieved on the Client-side as documented.

# Dependencies

Following technologies have been used in the project.

- Java Spring Boot, PostgreSQL for server side and Database.
- Vue for client side.

# Qlinbay Travel Client

Vue client for the project has following pages

- "/" - Root Page of the FE Client. Has the search card. Takes inputs from the user and then using Axios calls the API on written on the server-side and sends the user input in the Request body

# Qlinbay Travel Server

Server-side has microservices-based architecture and we are using API Gateway to route and filter the API service requests.

## Microservices used:

1. Booking Service
    - Search API: This API takes input from users and performs a search based on user input on flight table and return a response that contains flight details.
    - Checkout API: This API reduces the number of seats from flight table after user has made the payment and booked the flight ticket after performing a check on flight table.
2. Login Service
    - Login API:  Used for authentication part so that user can login into our website. Login API fetched data from login table and checks whether the data user data is valid. Based  on  user data login API returns response after validation.
    - Register API : Performs user registration. The user data is stored in login database so that user can access our website after registration
3. Admin Services
    - Admin Login: This API is used for Admin Authentication so that admin can access certain additional permissions like making changes in flight database, adding flights.
    - Add Flights: Add flights API is used for adding flights into our flight table. Here only admin can add  the details about flights after authentication.
4. Booking Details

### Dependencies:

- PostgreSQL
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Netflix Zuul

2. GET "/history/getHistory/{userName}

    Wrote a GET API which takes userName and then returns the complete booking details in response. 

    Response: 

    ![Airline%20Reservation%20System%20e894d171a18d48febdd29b224277084e/Screen_Shot_2021-03-08_at_12.07.02.png](Airline%20Reservation%20System%20e894d171a18d48febdd29b224277084e/Screen_Shot_2021-03-08_at_12.07.02.png)

4 . Booking Services APIs

1. POST "/search"

    Search API uses the composite key feature of JPA to combine two primary keys to form one individual primary key. We have used "Date" and "Flight Id" to form our composite key since same flights can be scheduled multiple times in multiple days.
